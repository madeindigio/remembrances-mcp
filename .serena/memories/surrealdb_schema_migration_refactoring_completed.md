# SurrealDB Schema Migration Refactoring - Completed

## Summary
Successfully refactored the `surrealdb_schema.go` file by separating migration functions into individual files within the `internal/storage/migrations/` directory structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Migration Directory Structure
- Created `internal/storage/migrations/` directory

### 2. Created Base Migration Interface
- `migration.go`: Contains the core migration interface and common functionality
  - `Migration` interface with `Apply()`, `Version()`, and `Description()` methods
  - `MigrationBase` struct providing common functionality
  - `SchemaElement` struct moved from main schema file
  - Helper methods: `CheckTableExists()`, `IsAlreadyExistsError()`, etc.
  - `ApplyElements()` method for applying schema elements with error handling

### 3. Separated Migration Implementations
- `v1_initial_schema.go`: Initial schema creation (version 1)
  - Creates all base tables (kv_memories, vector_memories, knowledge_base, entities, relationships)
  - Defines fields and indexes for all tables
  
- `v2_user_stats.go`: User statistics table (version 2)
  - Adds user_stats table with count fields
  - Creates indexes for efficient user lookups
  
- `v3_fix_user_stats.go`: Fixes user_stats field definitions (version 3)
  - Removes VALUE constraints from count fields
  - Recreates fields with proper type definitions

### 4. Refactored Main Schema File
- Updated `surrealdb_schema.go` to use new migration structure
- `applyMigration()` now creates migration instances and calls their `Apply()` method
- Removed duplicate migration functions and helper methods
- Added wrapper methods for `checkTableExists()` and `isAlreadyExistsError()` that delegate to migration base

### 5. Module Structure
- Proper Go module imports using `github.com/madeindigio/remembrances-mcp`
- Clean separation of concerns between schema management and individual migrations

## Benefits
1. **Modularity**: Each migration is now in its own file, making them easier to understand and maintain
2. **Reusability**: Common migration functionality is centralized in the base class
3. **Extensibility**: Adding new migrations only requires creating a new file and updating the switch statement
4. **Clarity**: Each migration file focuses solely on its specific changes
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to review, test, and debug individual migrations

## Testing
- Build completed successfully with `xc build`
- All compilation errors resolved
- Migration interface properly implemented across all versions

## Future Migration Pattern
To add a new migration (e.g., v4):
1. Create `v4_description.go` file in the migrations directory
2. Implement the `Migration` interface with proper version number and description
3. Add case for version 4 in `applyMigration()` switch statement
4. Update target version in `InitializeSchema()`
