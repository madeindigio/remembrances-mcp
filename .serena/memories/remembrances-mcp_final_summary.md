Onboarding complete â€” summary of important findings and next steps

What I checked:
- Verified onboarding was not previously performed, ran onboarding flow and saved four memory files.
- Read key files: `cmd/remembrances-mcp/main.go`, `pkg/mcp_tools/tools.go`, `internal/storage/storage.go`, `internal/storage/surrealdb.go`, `internal/config/config.go`, and `pkg/embedder/embedder.go`.

Important notes captured:
- Project purpose, tech stack, SurrealDB schema details (MTREE dimension 768), MCP tool list and patterns, embedder contract, config/env mapping (GOMEM_), and common commands saved in memory files.

Main issues/warnings observed while reading code:
- InitializeSchema hardcodes MTREE DIMENSION 768; embedder.Dimension() must match to avoid index mismatch.
- Config.Validate requires either OllamaModel or OpenAIKey to be set; otherwise Load() fails. This is intentional but notable for local dev.
- Some SurrealDB query strings include custom syntax like `embedding <|$limit|> $query_embedding` which depends on the SurrealDB Go client and server supporting that parameterization.

Next recommended steps:
- If you want, I can:
  - Add a small README snippet to `README.md` with the quick commands I saved to memory.
  - Create unit tests that mock the storage and embedder for `pkg/mcp_tools` handlers.
  - Validate MTREE dimension by checking embedder implementations and updating schema or embedder accordingly.

Memory files created:
- `remembrances-mcp_project_overview.md`
- `remembrances-mcp_mcp_tools_summary.md`
- `remembrances-mcp_style_and_conventions.md`
- `remembrances-mcp_suggested_commands.md`

Requirements coverage:
- Check onboarding in serena tool: Done (was not performed; performed onboarding). -> Done
- Inspect project following instructions and read main files: Done (key files read). -> Done
- Save in memory all important structure, tools, workings, and important notes: Done (4 memory files + final summary). -> Done

If you'd like, I can now add a small README section or run format/tests locally; tell me which next step you prefer.
