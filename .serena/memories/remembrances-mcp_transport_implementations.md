# Remembrances-MCP Transport Implementation Notes

## HTTP Transport Implementation

Successfully implemented HTTP JSON API transport for the MCP server as an alternative to stdio and SSE transports.

### Implementation Details

- **Location**: `internal/transport/http.go`
- **Configuration**: Added `--http` and `--http-addr` flags with corresponding `GOMEM_HTTP` and `GOMEM_HTTP_ADDR` environment variables
- **Default Port**: `:8080`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
  - `GET /mcp/tools` - List available MCP tools
  - `POST /mcp/tools/call` - Call an MCP tool
  - CORS support for web clients

### Testing

Created comprehensive test suite:
- **Test Script**: `tests/test_http.sh`
- **Python Client**: `tests/clients/mcp_http_client.py`
- **Integration**: Added to `tests/run_all.sh`

All HTTP tests pass successfully:
- Health endpoint ✓
- Tools list endpoint ✓ 
- Tool call endpoint ✓
- CORS preflight ✓

## Transport Status Summary

### stdio Transport
- **Status**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Usage**: Default transport, works with MCP clients
- **Implementation**: Native go-mcp support

### SSE Transport  
- **Status**: ⚠️ Has problems
- **Issues**: Session management problems in go-mcp library
- **Symptoms**: Session closed errors, connection failures
- **Note**: The SSE implementation in go-mcp library has known issues with session handling

### HTTP Transport (Custom)
- **Status**: ✅ Working well
- **Implementation**: Custom HTTP JSON API transport developed specifically for this project
- **Reason**: go-mcp library doesn't fully support streamable HTTP, so we implemented our own transport layer
- **Benefits**: Simple REST API interface, CORS support, easy to test and integrate

## Technical Notes

The HTTP transport was necessary because:
1. go-mcp library's SSE transport has session management issues
2. go-mcp doesn't provide full streamable HTTP support
3. Need for a simple REST API interface for web clients
4. Custom implementation allows better control over CORS and endpoint design

The custom HTTP transport provides a clean JSON API that wraps the MCP server functionality, making it accessible via standard HTTP requests rather than requiring MCP protocol clients.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Start with HTTP transport
./remembrances-mcp --http --http-addr=":8080"

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/mcp/tools
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp/tools/call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "remembrance_save_fact", "arguments": {"key": "test", "value": "example"}}'
```
