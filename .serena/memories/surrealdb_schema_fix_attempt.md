# SurrealDB Schema Check Warning Fix Attempt

## Problem
Warning appeared during schema initialization:
```
Warning: Could not check if schema_version table exists: Versioned error: A deserialization error occurred: Invalid revision `47` for type `DefineTableStatement`
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The warning is caused by a version compatibility issue between the SurrealDB Go client library and the SurrealDB server version. When running `INFO FOR DB;` command, the server returns schema definitions in a format that the client can't deserialize due to revision compatibility.

## Fix Applied
Updated all `surrealdb.Query` calls to use consistent array-based return types `[]map[string]interface{}` instead of `map[string]interface{}` to match the pattern used successfully elsewhere in the codebase:

### Fixed Methods:
1. `checkTableExists` - Changed to use `Query[[]map[string]interface{}]`
2. `checkFieldExists` - Changed to use `Query[[]map[string]interface{}]`  
3. `checkIndexExists` - Changed to use `Query[[]map[string]interface{}]`
4. `applyMigrationV1` migration statements - Changed to use `Query[[]map[string]interface{}]`
5. `ensureSchemaVersionTable` - Changed to use `Query[[]map[string]interface{}]`
6. `CreateRelationship` - Changed to use `Query[[]map[string]interface{}]`
7. `Ping` method - Changed to use `Query[[]map[string]interface{}]`

## Result
- Build successful
- Test completed successfully  
- Functions are working correctly
- Warning persists but is caught and handled gracefully

## Explanation
The warning indicates a low-level deserialization issue in the SurrealDB client when trying to parse schema information from the server. This is likely due to:

1. **Version mismatch**: Client library expecting different data format than server provides
2. **Schema revision incompatibility**: Server using newer schema revision format

## Impact
- **Functional**: No impact - system works correctly, schema operations succeed
- **Cosmetic**: Warning appears in logs but is caught and handled  
- **Workaround**: The code gracefully handles the error and continues with table creation

## Recommendation
To completely eliminate the warning, consider:
1. Upgrading SurrealDB client library to match server version
2. Upgrading/downgrading SurrealDB server to match client expectations
3. The current approach is acceptable as it's handled gracefully
