=== EVENTS TOOLS GROUP ===

Temporal event storage for logs, conversations, and historical data.

OVERVIEW
--------
The events system provides a way to store and retrieve temporal events with:
- Automatic timestamps
- Semantic subject categorization
- Hybrid search (BM25 text + vector similarity)
- Time-based filtering

TOOLS
-----
1. save_event - Store an event with timestamp and semantic subject
2. search_events - Query events with hybrid text+vector search

SUBJECT PATTERNS
----------------
Use descriptive subject patterns to categorize events:

- conversation:session_id  - Conversation logs (e.g., "conversation:chat_001")
- log:category            - Application logs (e.g., "log:build", "log:deploy")
- audit:action            - Audit trail events (e.g., "audit:file_modified")
- milestone:name          - Project milestones (e.g., "milestone:v1.0_released")
- error:type              - Error events (e.g., "error:runtime", "error:validation")

TIME QUERIES
------------
You can filter events by time using:

Absolute dates (RFC3339 format):
- from_date: "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
- to_date: "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"

Relative offsets (mutually exclusive, pick one):
- last_hours: 24    - Get events from the last 24 hours
- last_days: 7      - Get events from the last 7 days
- last_months: 3    - Get events from the last 3 months

HYBRID SEARCH
-------------
When you provide a query, the system performs hybrid search:
1. BM25 text matching (50% weight) - Finds events containing query terms
2. Vector similarity (50% weight) - Finds semantically related events

This ensures you find both exact matches and related content.

USE CASES
---------
1. Conversation History:
   Save each message with subject="conversation:session_123"
   Later, search with subject filter to get full history

2. Build Logs:
   Save build events with subject="log:build"
   Query with time filter to see recent builds

3. Audit Trail:
   Save user actions with subject="audit:user_action"
   Search with query to find specific activities

4. Error Tracking:
   Save errors with subject="error:type" and metadata
   Use time filters to find recent issues
