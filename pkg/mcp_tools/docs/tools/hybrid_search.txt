TOOL: remembrance_hybrid_search
================================

PURPOSE
-------
Run a combined search over facts, vectors, documents, and graph data for a user.

Perform a hybrid search across vectors, graph, and key-value facts.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Combines semantic vector search, graph traversal (filtered by entities), 
and exact-fact lookup to produce a consolidated result set and timing stats.

WHEN TO CALL
------------
Use when you need the broadest coverage for a query that may be answered 
by facts, documents, graph links, or semantic memories.

ARGUMENTS
---------
user_id: string (required)
    The user identifier. If unsure, use the current project name.

query: string (required)
    The search query.

entities: array of strings (optional)
    Entity types to include in graph search (e.g., ["person", "project"]).

limit: integer (optional, default: 10)
    Maximum results per category.

EXAMPLE
-------
{
    "user_id": "my-project",
    "query": "Who worked on project X and what notes exist?",
    "entities": ["person", "project"],
    "limit": 10
}
