TOOL: code_hybrid_search
========================

Combined semantic and pattern search for code.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Performs both semantic search (by meaning) and pattern matching in a single query.
Returns results ranked by relevance across both search types.

WHEN TO CALL
------------
Use when you want comprehensive search results that combine semantic understanding
with exact pattern matching.

ARGUMENTS
---------
project_id: string (required)
    The project ID to search in.

query: string (required)
    Natural language query for semantic search.

languages: array of strings (optional)
    Filter by programming languages (go, typescript, python, etc).

symbol_types: array of strings (optional)
    Filter by symbol types (class, function, method, interface, etc).

path_pattern: string (optional)
    Filter by file path pattern (e.g., "src/auth/**").

include_chunks: boolean (optional, default: false)
    Search in code chunks for better large-symbol coverage.

limit: integer (optional, default: 20)
    Maximum number of results.

EXAMPLE
-------
{
    "project_id": "my-app",
    "query": "authentication middleware",
    "languages": ["go"],
    "symbol_types": ["function", "method"],
    "path_pattern": "src/middleware/**",
    "limit": 15
}
