TOOL: code_find_symbol
======================

Find symbols by name or path pattern.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Searches for symbols matching a name pattern. Supports three pattern types:
- Absolute: "/ClassName/methodName" - Exact match of full path
- Suffix: "ClassName/methodName" - Match by path suffix
- Simple: "methodName" - Match by name anywhere

Use depth > 0 to also retrieve children (e.g., methods of a class).
Use substring_matching for partial name matches.

WHEN TO CALL
------------
Use when you know the approximate name of a symbol and want to find its definition.

ARGUMENTS
---------
project_id: string (required)
    The project ID to search in.

name_path_pattern: string (required)
    Symbol name or path pattern to match.

relative_path: string (optional)
    Restrict search to this file or directory.

depth: integer (optional, default: 0)
    Include children up to this depth level (0=symbol only, 1=direct children).

include_body: boolean (optional, default: false)
    Include source code in results.

include_kinds: array of strings (optional)
    Filter by symbol types (class, function, method, interface).

exclude_kinds: array of strings (optional)
    Exclude these symbol types.

substring_matching: boolean (optional, default: false)
    Enable partial name matching.

EXAMPLE
-------
{
    "project_id": "my-app",
    "name_path_pattern": "UserService/createUser",
    "include_body": true,
    "depth": 1
}
