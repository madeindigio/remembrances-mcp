FIND_IMPLEMENTATIONS TOOL
=========================

PURPOSE: Locate concrete implementations of an interface or abstract symbol.

USAGE:
  Provide the interface/abstract symbol to list implementing symbols across the project.

NOTES:
  Handy for polymorphic codebases; pairs with find_references for deeper analysis.
