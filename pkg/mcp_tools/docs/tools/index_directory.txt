INDEX_DIRECTORY TOOL
====================

PURPOSE: Index a specific directory tree within a repository.

USAGE:
  Provide the directory path to index so the code search backend processes only that subtree.

NOTES:
  Useful for narrowing indexing scope; aligns with code_index_project when targeting a subpath.
