MEMORY TOOLS GROUP
===================

MEMORY TOOLS DOCUMENTATION
--------------------------

This group provides a 3-layer memory system: key-value facts, semantic vectors, and knowledge graph.

USER_ID NOTE: If you are unsure which user_id to use, use the current project name as the user_id.

KEY-VALUE FACTS
---------------
Store simple key-value pairs for exact retrieval.

- save_fact: Store a key-value fact
- get_fact: Retrieve a fact by exact key
- list_facts: List all facts for a user
- delete_fact: Delete a specific fact

SEMANTIC VECTORS
----------------
Store content with embeddings for semantic similarity search.

- add_vector: Add content with automatic embedding
- search_vectors: Search by semantic similarity
- update_vector: Update content and re-embed
- delete_vector: Remove a vector entry

KNOWLEDGE GRAPH
---------------
Create entities and relationships for structured data.

- create_entity: Create a typed entity (person, project, etc.)
- create_relationship: Link two entities
- traverse_graph: Explore entity connections
- get_entity: Get entity details by ID

UTILITIES
---------
- hybrid_search: Search across all three layers
- get_stats: Get memory usage statistics
- to_remember: Store important context for future sessions
- last_to_remember: Retrieve stored context and recent activity

WHEN TO USE EACH LAYER
----------------------
- FACTS: Settings, preferences, structured data with known keys
- VECTORS: Notes, ideas, content you'll search by meaning
- GRAPH: Entities with relationships (people, projects, concepts)

Use how_to_use("tool_name") for detailed documentation on any specific tool.
